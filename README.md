## Today’s Homework — *Very Important!*

1. You can use **any editor** to write your program.  
   However, the program **must be able to compile and run** on the environment specified (see next slide for details).  
   Please **test your code** before submission.

2. If the program **cannot compile**, it will receive a **score of 0**,  
   regardless of the reason (e.g., “it works on my computer” will not be accepted).

## Turning In Your Homework

*(You can find your HomeworkID in the top-right corner of the homework slides.)*
